Bubble sort is a basic sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly going through a list, comparing adjacent items, and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. It's called "bubble sort" because smaller elements slowly "bubble" to the top of the list.

In assembly language, you implement bubble sort with loops to go through the array several times. Each pass compares and swaps adjacent elements if needed. This involves using registers to load and compare values, conditional jumps to decide if a swap is needed, and swapping values in memory. The outer loop repeats the process, and the inner loop handles the comparisons and swaps.
